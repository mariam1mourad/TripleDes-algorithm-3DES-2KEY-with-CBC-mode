# TripleDes-algorithm-3DES-2KEY-with-CBC-mode
This is a project given by University of Pristina professor. We have combined source code and our experience to get this done. 

# Usage
In this project we have developed an application that enables encryption and decryption of files using the TripleDes algorithm, specifically 3DES-2KEY, in conjunction with the CBC mode. This advanced encryption technique involves the use of three distinct keys to secure data, ensuring a high level of protection against unauthorized access.
The CBC mode is an effective method of enhancing the security of the encryption process. By dividing the data into blocks and encrypting each block individually, the mode adds an additional layer of complexity to the process, making it more difficult for anyone attempting to breach the encryption.
//////////////////////////////////////////
If u want to encrypt and decrypt files you need to download python, then pip install pycryptodome in terminal so you can use that library of python. After this just go run file then in 2 steps:

file path: type the .txt or any file's path u want to test
key: type any keyword u want to encrypt with but remember that keyword is needed to decrypt the file again.


# Language
We have used programming language Java. This code is open source which people implemented before but we just managed to make changes and make that one work for our needs, so if anyone has problem with it feel free to contact us.
